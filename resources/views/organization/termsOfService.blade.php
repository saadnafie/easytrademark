                <span>Dispute resolution:</span> These Terms require the use of mediation and arbitration on an
                individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limit
                the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute. In the unlikely event of a dispute
                arising out of or relating to any engagement entered into on the site, it is mutually agreed
                that before embarking arbitration proceedings we will attempt to resolve it through
                negotiations between senior executives and you or your authorised representative (who
                have the authority to settle such matters). If the matter is not resolved through negotiation,
                we shall endeavour to agree upon the nomination and appointment of an independent
                mediator upon receipt of a written notice, by either of us to the other, to concur in such
                nomination and appointment. Should either of us fail to concur in such nomination and
                appointment within 14 days, either party may apply for the appointment of a mediator.
                Each of us will give due weight to the views of the mediator and will hope to resolve the
                dispute as a result thereof,
            </p><br>
            <p>
                In the unlikely event that the mediation fails to resolve the dispute out of or relating to any
                engagement entered into on the site, it is mutually agreed that either of us may, upon giving
                written notice to the other and within 28 days thereof, apply for arbitration in accordance
                with the provisions set forth under the Rules of Commercial Conciliation and Arbitration
                (“the Rules”) of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, by one arbitrator appointed
                in compliance with the Rules. The arbitration shall take place in the premises of the Dubai
                International Arbitration Centre. English Language shall be used in the written and oral
                submissions, in the procedural orders and in the award(s) issued by the arbitrator.
