                                same character in a different language. In addition, a search results in most
                                jurisdictions does not include the trademarks which are under process, have
                                been filed but not published, or have been filed and rejected. It should be
                                noted as well, that most of the trademark offices databases are not complete
                                and therefore the outcome of the search may still get the mark rejected after

                                in order to get the best results and be able to decide on next steps, and it is

                                as some TMOs offer the service for identical marks only, which could
                                potentially create a risk of trademark infringement and block the trademark

                                usually on relative grounds.

                                reflect the fees to change agent to ensure all formality requirements are met.

                                application, change, or renewal incurs additional penalty charges.

                                assignment application, change, or renewal (less than 7 working days) is my
                                sole responsibility;

                                are not available, and therefore if I do not submit all required documents on
                                a timely basis I am held liable for any penalties which arise;

                                inaccurate deadlines (such as requesting a renewal before expiry while the
                                mark had lapsed);

                            directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys

                            particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark
                            application for legal reasons beyond the scope of Easy trademarks LLC.’s service. In some
                            cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is
                            complete. Similarly, Easy trademarks LLC.. does not guarantee the results or outcomes of
                            the services rendered by affiliates and suppliers.

                            procedures. Delay in settlement by the client may lead to loss of rights, which
                            the Easy trademarks LLC.. will not be liable for. Settlement of official fees and professional
